          <p>1) Shoulder Press <br> Stand with the bar on your front shoulders, and your hands next to your shoulders
            Press the bar over your head, until itâ€™s balanced over your shoulders and mid-foot
            Lock your elbows at the top, and shrug your shoulders to the ceiling.
            Hold the bar for a second at the top. Then lower it back to your front shoulders and repeat.

          <p>2) Dumbbell Lateral Raise <br> Grab a set of dumbbells and stand straight up with the dumbbells at your sides.
            Your palms should be facing your body. Hold the dumbbells slightly off your body.
            Slowly raise the dumbbells up to around shoulder height. It's important that you do not let your wrists go above your elbows 
            while raising the weight, as this will take the work off the side delts and put it on the front delts.
            Pause at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position.

          <p>3) Dumbbell Reverse Fly <br>  Grab a pair of dumbbells and stand with your feet hip-width apart and your knees slightly bent. 
            Hinge forward at the hips and let your arms hang straight down from your shoulders, palms facing your body.
             Raise both arms out to the sides as you squeeze your shoulder blades together. Return to start.  </p>
