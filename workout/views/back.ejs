    <h1>Back</h1>
    <p id="Description">The muscles of the back are a group of strong, paired muscles that lie on the 
      posterior aspect of the trunk. They provide movements of the spine, stability to the trunk, as well as the 
      coordination between the movements of the limbs and trunk.</p>
    <div id="Descriptions">
    <p>1) DumbBell Bent over Row <br>With a dumbbell in each hand, bend over at about a 45-degree angle. Keep the back straight throughout
       the exercise. Brace your abdominals and breathe in.
      Lift the weights straight up, exhaling. While lifting, the arms should go no higher than parallel with the 
      shouldersâ€”slightly lower than the shoulders is fine. While lifting, try to keep the wrists from excessive extra 
      movement down or to the side. Do not squat down and up after the initial pose. No movement of the legs occurs throughout 
      the exercise.
      Lower the weights in a controlled manner while inhaling.
      Remain bent over until all repetitions are complete. </p>

      <p>2) Kettlebell Swings <br> Place a kettlebell a couple of feet in front of you. Stand with your feet slightly wider than 
        shoulder-width apart and bend your knees to lean forward and grab the handle with both hands. With your back flat,
         engage your lats to pull the weight between your legs (be careful with how deep you swing) then drive your hips forward and
          explosively pull the kettlebell up to shoulder height with your arms straight in front of you. Return to the start position
           and repeat without pauses.  </p>

    <p>3) Farmers Walk <br> Hold two kettlebells or dumbbells by your side. 
      Keep your arms strong and walk short, quick steps as fast as possible a pre determined distance.
       Turn around and walk back.  </p>
