    <h1 class="text-center">Triceps</h1>
    <p id="Description">The triceps, also triceps brachii (Latin for "three-headed muscle of the arm"), is a large
      muscle on the
      back of the upper limb of many vertebrates. It consists of 3 parts: the medial, lateral, and long head.
      It is the muscle principally responsible for extension of the elbow joint (straightening of the arm).</p>
    <div id="Descriptions">
      <p>1) Close-Grip Bench Press <br> Grab a barbell with an overhand grip, keeping your index fingers on the inside
        edge of the
        knurling (i.e. the rough and textural part of the bar)
        Slightly arch your back to create minor space between your lower back and the bench.
        Life the bar off the rack and hold it above your sternum, keeping your arms completely straight and your elbows
        tucked
        at 45-degree angles on either side.
        Lower the bar until it lightly touches your body, pause, and then drive through at your feet as you press the
        bar upward.
        For the last set, consider reducing the weight and then increasing the number of reps, pushing yourself to
        failure. </p>

      <p>2) Lying Triceps Extension <br> Grabbing the inner grip, press an EZ bar over your chest in the overhand grip
        position.
        Extend your arms straight up.
        Keeping your elbows tucked in and your arms perpendicular to the floor, gradually lower the bar until itâ€™s just
        above your
        forehead by about an inch.
        Slowly bring your arms back to the starting position without locking your elbows.
        Repeat. </p>

      <p>3) Diamond Push-Ups <br> Assume the push-up position, but with your hands together in a diamond-like formation
        (i.e. index fingers and thumbs touching).
        Keeping your back straight, lower your chest until it almost touches the floor.
        Rise and repeat. </p>
