        <p>1) Plank <br> Begin face down with your forearms and toes on the floor. 
          Your elbows are directly under your shoulders.
          Your head is relaxed and you should be looking at the floor.
          Engage your abdominal muscles, drawing your navel toward your spine. 
          Keep your torso straight and rigid and your body in a straight line from ears to toes with no sagging or bending. 
          Your heels should be over the balls of your feet.
          Hold this position for 30 seconds. Release to floor. </p>

          Engage your core and lift your upper body so your right elbow touches your left knee.
          Return to the start position then lift your upper body so your left elbow touches your right knee.
          Return to the start position.  </p>

          Keep your legs straight and lift them all the way up to the ceiling until your butt comes off the floor. 
          
          Slowly lower your legs back down till theyâ€™re just above the floor. Hold for a moment.
          
          Raise your legs back up. Repeat.  </p>
